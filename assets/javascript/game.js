// Inital screen set up, hard coded in HTML

// Part One.
// When ANY character is chosen, other characters move to the ENEMIES stage and their background turn red.
// The CHOOSE AN ENEMY stage flag is dynamically created when ANY character is chosen. 
// Whichever character is chosen moves down and is labeled "your character"
// The above three lines should happen inside the character click event. 

// Part two.
// Once an enemy is clicked, the enemy moves down into the staging area and the 
// other enemies backgrounds turn back to white.
// The attack button is dynamically created. 


// Part three.
// When the attack button is clicked, text-based attacks are made. 
// The enemies attack amount should always be the same, whereas the player's
// character should gain in attack HP each time. 

// If the enemy reaches 0 HP, the player has won. a message stating "You've won!
// Choose another enemy to fight" should display. Another enemy is selected and the patten repeats
// until the player has defeated all of the enemies. 

// IF however the player reaches 0 HP before any of the enemies, it is game over. 
// A message alerting the player they have lost should appear, and a reset game button should display. 

// When reset game is selected, initializeGame function should run.
